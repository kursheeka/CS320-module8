To make sure my code works and is safe, I test it over and over to make sure it runs properly. I can write tests to check if everything runs the way it should and fix any mistakes. I make sure not to leave any weak spots where hackers could break in by using strong passwords, keeping my code updated, and not sharing secret info in my program helps keep it secure.
 I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program first by listening to what people want. I'll figure out what features would help them people then design the program to make it easy to use and solve their problem. Also test it with real people to make sure it actually works for them and make changes if needed.
I approach designing software by starting with a plan. I think about what the program needs to do, sketch out how it should look and work. Afterwards, I write the code step by step, testing along the way and if something doesn’t work, I fix it and keep improving until it’s right.
